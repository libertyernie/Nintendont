### What Nintendont will never support:

### Quick Installation:
1. Get the [loader.dol](loader/loader.dol?raw=true), rename it to boot.dol and put it in /apps/Nintendont/ along with the files [meta.xml](nintendont/meta.xml?raw=true) and [icon.png](nintendont/icon.png?raw=true).
2. Copy your GameCube games to the /games/ directory. Subdirectories are optional for 1-disc games in ISO/GCM and CISO format.
   * For 2-disc games, you should create a subdirectory /games/MYGAME/ (where MYGAME can be anything), then name disc 1 as "game.iso" and disc 2 as "disc2.iso".
   * For extracted FST, the FST must be located in a subdirectory, e.g. /games/FSTgame/sys/boot.bin .
3. Connect your storage device to your Wii or Wii U and start The Homebrew Channel.
4. Select Nintendont.

### Notes
* The Wii and Wii U SD card slot is known to be slow. If you're using an SD card and are having performance issues, consider either using a USB SD reader or a USB hard drive.
* USB flash drives are known to be problematic.
* Nintendont runs best with storage devices formatted with 32 KB clusters. (Use either FAT32 or exFAT.)
